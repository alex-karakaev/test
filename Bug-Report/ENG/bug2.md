##2. Disappearance of level textures after cutscene.

**Type**: Bug

**Priority**: -

**Game**: Baldur’s Gate 3

**Version**: 4.1.1.4763283 from 04.02.2025

**OS/Platform**: Windows 11/Steam

**Component**: Visual bug/Asset loading

**Brief description**: After exiting the cutscene, the environment textures disappear. 

**Description**: At the end of the quest in the Temple of Shar, players must stand on an elevator platform. After interacting with the platform and starting it, a cutscene is triggered. After the cutscene ends, all environmental textures disappear, leaving only placeholder textures and backdrops. This can be fixed by reloading the save. 

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Enter the game and load the save file.
2. Have the entire group stand on the elevator.
3. Interact with the elevator by pressing the “E” key or clicking on it with the left mouse button.
4. Watch the cutscene and/or select dialogue options in it.
5. Finish the cutscene and observe the result.

**Expected result**: after exiting the cutscene, the group is on the platform and moves to the lower floors of the Temple to continue the quest. 

**Actual result**: the characters move further on the platform, but the textures of the Temple itself and the surroundings are no longer there.
