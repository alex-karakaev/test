##3. Character hair disappears from the model in the inventory.

**Type**: Bug

**Priority**: -

**Game**: Baldur’s Gate 3

**Version**: 4.1.1.4763283 from 07.02.2025

**OS/Platform**: Windows 11/Steam

**Component**: Visual bug/ Asset loading

**Brief description**: When wearing a helmet and switching its display mode, the character's hair disappears on the miniature in the inventory. 

**Description**: If you put on one specific helmet (the bug did not occur with others) and select the option “Do not display helmet in dialogues,” then when you re-enter the inventory, you will see that the hair on the character's thumbnail is not displayed. The bug also appeared in the co-op lobby—the textures were not displayed for other players either. 

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Go to the inventory.
2. Put the Justiciar's Helm on the character.
3. Select the “Do not show in dialogues” helmet display type in the inventory.
4. Exit the inventory. 
5. Go to the inventory. 
6. Observe the result.

**Expected result**: The character's thumbnail is displayed correctly with full armor.

**Actual result**: The character has no helmet or hair on their head.
